# How equal are you in Kosovo?
On November 19, 2015, BBC News published "[How equal are you?](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-34808717)": an excellent interactive analysis on gender inequality across several countries.

Unfortunately, Kosovo wasn't one of the analyzed countries. In response to this omission, [Kosova Women's Network](http://www.womensnetwork.org/) and [Open Data Kosovo](http://opendatakosovo.org) have teamed up and produced "How equal are you in Kosovo?"
